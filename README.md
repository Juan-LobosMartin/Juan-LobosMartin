## About me

Driven by a lifelong fascination with science and technology, I witnessed the transformative power of computers, aviation, nanotechnology, and the internet.

After years of knowing GitHub as a place to find good software, small applications for my computer, or firmware for the drones or the remote control that I use. 
I started to find the real dimension of it entering the Data World. 

I am new, and I will try to use it in the correct way to have temporal control of my code work.

Here, you will find projects that I saw interest in learning more about data analysis, machine learning, or deep learning.
In time, I want to be able to collaborate in libraries for phyton to increase the possibilities of the research with the Data.

See you around
Juan
