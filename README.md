## About me

Hi everyone, I'm Juan Lobos.

Having witnessed the transformative power of computers, aeronautics, nanotechnology and the internet from a young age, I've been driven by a lifelong fascination with science and technology.

Until now, I've used GitHub as a place to find small applications for my desktop and firmware for the drones I've designed and built.
In 2025, after completing a Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, I decided to finally create my own portfolio.

Here you will find projects that caught my interest and made me want to delve deeper into Data Analysis and Modelling with Python.

See you around ðŸ‘‹
